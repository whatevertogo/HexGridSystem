# HexGridSystem-

#### [中文](README.md)

This project is a hexagonal grid system that can be used to create hexagonal maps in the Unity game engine. It provides a set of C# scripts, including HexCell, HexCoordinates, HexGrid, HexGridHighlight, HexMesh, and HexMetrics, which help developers quickly build hexagonal grid maps.

## Key Features

- **HexCell**: Defines the basic properties and behaviors of hexagonal grid cells
- **HexCoordinates**: Implements a cubic coordinate system for easy positioning and calculation of hexagonal grids
- **HexGrid**: Manages the creation, layout, and updating of hexagonal grids
- **HexGridHighlight**: Provides highlighting and selection functionality for grid cells
- **HexMesh**: Dynamically generates mesh models for hexagonal grids with customizable appearances
- **HexMetrics**: Defines hexagonal geometric parameters and constants to ensure grid consistency

## Technology Stack

- C#
- Unity Game Engine

## How to Use

1. Import the HexSystem folder into your Unity project
2. Create an empty GameObject in your scene and add the HexGrid component
3. Configure parameters such as grid size, cell prefab, etc.
4. Run the scene to view and interact with the hexagonal grid
